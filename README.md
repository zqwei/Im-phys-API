# List Of Calcium Imaging Deconvolution Methods

[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/zqwei/Ca-Imaging-Deconv-List.svg)](https://gitter.im/zqwei/Ca-Imaging-Deconv-List?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)

Here is a collection of published calcium imaging deconvolution methods and link to their codes.

A revision of each code for __basic performance test__ is marked as revision in list.

## Main goal

As a part of my thesis work (unpublished yet), we (Ziqiang Wei and Shaul Druckmann) will try to make a comparison of exisiting calcium imaging deconvolution methods, using the [published dataset](http://crcns.org/data-sets/methods/cai-1) from Karel Svoboda's lab, where both electrical and GCaMP optical responses of a single neuron are simultaneously recorded. We laid out serveral performance indice in comparison and left a note for the performance computation, which is not clear in the original codes. This comparison project is planned to be gradually invovled. In this case, one can leave notes in __Issues tracker__, if any new comparison is missing in list or any performance should be computed towards cross comparison.

> * Dataset description: Simultaneous imaging and loose-seal cell-attached electrical recordings from neurons expressing a variety of genetically encoded calcium indicators. The data is described in: Akerboom, et al JNS 2012 and Chen, et al Nature 2013. The data provides ground truth by recording electrical and GCaMP optical responses simultaneously.
